# Vibrational-physics-guided-neural-network
This repository provides a physics-guided deep learning framework (VPGNN) for analyzing the dynamic properties of 3D-printed soft auxetic metamaterials. The model integrates physical constraints with experimental impulse response data to directly estimate natural frequencies and damping ratios, supporting various structural configurations and physical metadata for enhanced accuracy and generalization.

# Highlights
● **Physics-Guided Learning**: Mass-spring-damper inspired loss function for physically consistent results

● **Metadata-Enhanced Predictions**: Integrates physical metadata for improved accuracy and generalization

● **Efficient Data Utilization**: Combines empirical data and analytical models for data-efficient learning

● **Scalable and Interpretable**: Suitable for complex, nonlinear systems like soft auxetic metamaterials

● Result saving and visualization (CSV, Matplotlib)
